<p>eorge," Clara said
with restrained fury,
"the least you could
do is ask him. Are you a mouse or
a worm?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have gone out there
and moved it every night,"
George protested, trying to reason
with her without success.</p>

<p>"Yes, and every morning he
puts it back. George, so long as
that trap is outside of our front
door, I can never have a moment's
peace, worrying about the
children. I won't go on like this!
You must go out and talk some
sense into him about removing it
at once."</p>

<p>"I don't know," George said
weakly. "They might not be
happy to find out about us."</p>

<p>"Well, our being here is their
own fault, remember that," Clara
snorted. "They deliverately exposed
your great-great grandfather
Michael to hard radiations.
George," she continued fervidly,
"all you have to do is to go out
and ask him. I'm sure he'll agree,
and then we'll have this menace
removed from our lives. I simply
can <i>not</i> go on like this another
minute!"</p>

<p>That, George knew, was a misstatement.
She could go on like
this for hours. He stared at her
unhappily.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," he mumbled finally.
"Well, maybe tomorrow."</p>

<p>"No, George," she said firmly.
"Now! This morning. The very
moment he comes in."</p>

<p>He looked at her silently, feeling
harried and unsure of himself.
After living here so long, they'd
observed and learned human customs
and speech&mdash;they'd even
adopted human names.</p>

<p>"George," she pleaded, "just
ask him. Reason with him. Point
out to him that he's just wasting
his time." She paused, added,
"You're intelligent&mdash;you can
think of the right things to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," he said wearily.
But once he had said it, he
felt better. At least, he would get
it over with, one way or another.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="37" height="40" /></div>
<p>s soon as he heard the swish-swish
of the broom outside
his home, he got up and walked
out of the front door. He saw
that the trap was still off to one
side, where he had pushed it the
night before.</p>

<p>"Hello," he shouted.</p>

<p>Swish-swish-swish went the
broom, busily moving dust from
one part of the room to another,
swish-swish-swish. The man
looked tremendous from so close
a view, yet George knew that he
was just a little, bent, old man, a
small specimen of the species.</p>

<p>George took a deep breath.
"<i>Hello!</i>" he bellowed with all his
strength.</p>

<p>The janitor stopped swish-swishing
and looked around the
room suspiciously.</p>

<p>"<i>Hello!</i>" George shrieked. His
throat felt raw.</p>

<p>The janitor looked down and
saw the mouse. "Hello yourself,"
he said. He was an ignorant old
man and, when he saw the mouse
shouting hello at him, he assumed
right away that it was a mouse
shouting hello to him.</p>

<p>"<i>The trap!</i>" the mouse bellowed.</p>

<p>"Stop <i>shouting</i>!" the janitor
cried, annoyed. He liked to think
as he worked, and he hated loud
noises. "What about the trap?"</p>

<p>"My wife doesn't want you to
put it by the front door any
more," George said, still speaking
loudly, so that the janitor
could hear, but at least not bellowing
so that it tore his throat.
"She's afraid it might hurt the
children."</p>

<p>"<i>Will</i> it hurt the children?" the
janitor demanded.</p>

<p>"No," George replied. "They
know all about traps&mdash;but my
wife still wants it removed."</p>

<p>"Sorry," the janitor said, "but
my orders are to put a trap by
every mousehole. This is an
atomic plant, and they don't
want mice."</p>

<p>"They do, too!" George said
defiantly. "They brought my
great-great-grandfather Michael
here themselves and exposed
him to hard radiations. Otherwise
<i>I</i> wouldn't be here."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," the janitor
snapped. "I have to obey orders."</p>

<p>"What will I tell my wife?"
George shouted.</p>

<p>That stopped the janitor. He
had a wife of his own.</p>

<p>"I guess I can take it up with
the supervisor," he finally said.</p>

<p>"All right," George shouted.
"<i>Thanks!</i>"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>

<p>he janitor picked up the trap
and moved it over to the front
door. He watched, interested, as
George promptly pushed it several
inches along the wall. Then
he turned and busily swish-swished
more dust around the room.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say?" Clara
asked George as soon as he came
back into the house.</p>

<p>"Said he'd take it up with the
supervisor," George said, settling
down in an armchair.</p>

<p>"George," she ordered, "you get
up this instant and make sure
that he really does!"</p>

<p>"Look," George pleaded, "he
said he would."</p>

<p>"He may have been lying,"
Clara said promptly. "You go
right up to the supervisor's room
and see."</p>

<p>So, George reluctantly heaved
himself out of the chair and ran
through the mouseways in the
wall until he came to the mousehole
in the supervisor's room.</p>

<p>At that moment, the janitor
came in and the supervisor looked
up, annoyed. He was a fat
man, with stubble on his cheek,
and he walked with a waddle.</p>

<p>"There's a mouse in room 112
who doesn't want a trap by his
front door," the janitor said simply.</p>

<p>"You're crazy," the supervisor
said.</p>

<p>The janitor shrugged. "What
should I tell him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Tell him to come up here
and speak to me himself," the supervisor
said, feeling very clever.</p>

<p>"I'm right here," George cried,
stepping out of the mousehole
and neatly side-stepping the
mousetrap beside it.</p>

<p>"There he is now," the janitor
said, pointing.</p>

<p>"My God!" whispered the supervisor,
who'd had some education.
"A hallucination."</p>

<p>"No, a mouse," the old janitor
corrected.</p>

<p>"My wife wants the trap
removed," George patiently explained.
"She's worried the children
might blunder into it."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> see him, too?" the
supervisor asked the janitor incredulously,
still whispering.</p>

<p>"Sure," the janitor replied.
"He's the one I was telling you
about, from room 112."</p>

<p>The supervisor stood up unsteadily.
"I don't feel very well,"
he said in a weak voice. "I think
that I'd better talk this over
with the Administrative Officer.
It's a policy matter."</p>

<p>"You come along, too," he said
hastily to the janitor, who had
turned to leave. "I'll need all the
support I can get." He waddled
out, followed by the janitor.</p>

<p>"<i>What should I tell my wife?</i>"
George shouted, but they didn't
answer, so he went down and told
his wife that they were discussing
it with the Administrative Officer.
And, as anyone could have guessed,
a short time later he pushed
his head out of the mousehole in
the Administrative Office.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="41" height="40" /></div>
<p>e was a bit late, just in time
to see the door close on the
supervisor and the janitor.</p>

<p>So he shouted, "<i>Hello!</i>" as loud
as he could.</p>

<p>The Administrative Officer
looked down and saw him right
away. He was a thin pale man
with tired eyes.</p>

<p>"Go away," he said spiritlessly,
"I've just told two people that
you don't exist."</p>

<p>"But my wife wants that trap
removed&mdash;it's dangerous for
the children," George complained.</p>

<p>The Administrative Officer almost
shouted to hell with
George's children, but basically
he was a decent man, even if an
overworked one, and he caught
himself in time.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said sincerely,
picking up some letters that he
had already read, "but we've got
to leave the traps."</p>

<p>"Then what will I tell my
wife?" George demanded.</p>

<p>That stopped the Administrative
Officer, too. He buried his
head in his hands and thought
for a long moment. "Are you sure
you <i>really</i> exist?" he asked, finally
raising his head from his
hands.</p>

<p>"Sure," George said. "Do you
want me to bite you to prove
it?"</p>

<p>"No, you needn't bother," the
Administrative Officer said. And
then he buried his head in his
hands again.</p>

<p>"Technically," he said, speaking
through his fingers, "it's a
security problem."</p>

<p>With an air of relief, he picked
up the phone and called the Security
Officer. There was a bit of
spirited conversation and then he
hung up.</p>

<p>"He'll be right down," the Administrative
Officer told George.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the door
violently swung open, and a tall
man with piercing eyes entered.
"Hello Bill," he said quickly.
"How are you feeling?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Mike," the Administrative
Officer replied. "I feel like
hell. This is George. I just called
you about him."</p>

<p>"Hello!" George shouted.</p>

<p>"Hello!" the Security Officer
shouted back. "I couldn't find
any record of you in the files.
Have you been cleared?" he added
with a note of urgency in his
voice. "Fingerprints, A.E.C.,
C.C.C., C.A.I., F.B.I.?"</p>

<p>"No!" George shouted back.
"My wife wants the trap by our
front door removed. She thinks
it's dangerous for the children."</p>

<p>"Has <i>she</i> been cleared?" the
Security Office countered in a
loud voice.</p>

<p>"Why is everybody shouting?"
the Administrative Officer asked
peevishly. "I've got a headache."</p>

<p>"No," George answered.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>

<p>he Security Officer's mouth
tightened into a thin, grim
line. "A major lapse of security,"
he snapped. "I'll check into this
very thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Will you remove the trap?"
George asked.</p>

<p>"I can't, until you're cleared,"
the Security Officer said, shaking
his head. "I certainly won't authorize
any action that could be
later construed as aiding the entrance
of spies or subversives into
the plant."</p>

<p>"How old are you?" the Administrative
Officer asked George.</p>

<p>"Fifty-six days," George replied
without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Under twelve years," the Administrative
Officer pointed out to
the Security Officer. "No clearance
required."</p>

<p>"I don't know," the Security
Officer said, shaking his head.
"There's no precedent for a case
like this. I'll be damned if I'll
stick my neck out and have that
trap removed. I know, I'll send
a request for an advisory opinion."
He turned and walked toward
the door.</p>

<p>"What should I tell my wife?"
George called after him.</p>

<p>"Tell her that I'm asking the
A.E.C. for an opinion, with carbon
copies to the Defense Dept.
and the F.B.I."</p>

<p>"Don't forget Immigration &amp;
Naturalization," the Administrative
Officer said. "There might be
a question of citizenship."</p>

<p>"The hell there is," George said.
"<i>Lex locis</i>&mdash;I was born here."</p>

<p>"Well," the Security Officer
said as he walked out, "one can't
be too careful."</p>

<p>So, George went and told his
wife and, the next morning, he
was on the train for Washington.
Being telepathic, as all this generation
of mice were, he already
had contacted some mice who
had an 'in' in the government
buildings.</p>

<p>All the way down on the train,
he worried about chasing all those
carbons in the bureaucratic maze
of Washington, but he needn't
have.</p>

<p>As soon as the Security Officer's
report was received, the
A.E.C. sent a battery of psychiatrists
to the plant. After the psychiatrists
reported, they, in turn,
were sent to another battery of
psychiatrists. After that, the
A.E.C. called a top-level conference
of the Defense Dept., F.B.I.
(Dept. Just.), Fish &amp; Wildlife
(Dept. Int.), Public Health
(Dept. Welf.), Immigration &amp;
Naturalization and Alaskan Affairs.
The latter turned out to be
a mistake.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>

<p>his had taken two weeks,
and George had lingered in
the walls, impatiently waiting for
his chance to testify. Of course,
he was in telepathic communication
with Clara. He knew that his
family were all well, that Clara
had made friends with the janitor,
also that the trap was still there.</p>

<p>The janitor no longer put
cheese in it, and he didn't set the
spring any more, but he still followed
his orders and so, every
morning, moved it back by the
door of the little mousehouse.</p>

<p>A fat Washington mouse guided
George to the mousehole in the
conference room. George looked
inside and sniffed the smoky air
distastefully.</p>

<p>There were seven men seated
at a long table, with a glass of
water in front of each. This was
a liquid that even George knew
was hardly designed to lubricate
the way to a quick agreement.</p>

<p>"<i>Bomb</i> them, I say," the General
cried, smashing his fist down
on the table. "Hit them hard with
atomic weapons. Hit them <i>now</i>,
before <i>they</i> have a chance to
strike first."</p>

<p>"But that's one of our best
plants," a civilian from the A.E.C.
protested. "We don't want to
blow it up, not for a few paltry
mice."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we send them to
Alaska?" the man from Alaskan
Affairs asked timidly, wondering
what he was doing there.</p>

<p>"How about traps?" the man
from Fish and Wildlife said. "We
have some honeys."</p>

<p>"But <i>that's just it</i>!" George
said in a loud voice, and they
all turned to look at him. "My
wife would like that trap by our
front door removed. She's afraid
that it might hurt the children."</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> are <i>you</i>?" the man from
Immigration &amp; Naturalization
demanded sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm George," George said.
"It's my house that has the trap
in front of it."</p>

<p>"What are you doing <i>here</i>?"
the man from the F.B.I. demanded.
"Spying on a closed meeting!"</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> spying!" George exclaimed.
"I just came to ask you
to please remove the trap."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>

<p>he man from the F.B.I. looked
at him with something
close to pity. "It's not that simple
any more," he said. "Don't you
realize what a threat you comprise?"</p>

<p>"No," George said, scampering
up the leg of the table and walking
to its center. "We're not a
threat to anybody. We're just
mice. It's not our nature to be a
threat to anybody."</p>

<p>Then, as he looked around the
table at the seven huge faces that
surrounded him, he immediately
saw that they were all scared half
to death because he was a mouse,
and he had a sudden premonition
that he would not come out
of the meeting alive. So he opened
his mind to let his family and
all the other telepathic mice hear
everything that was happening.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you don't fully
realize," the Fish and Wildlife
man demanded sarcastically, trying
to hide his terror beneath a
blustering tone, "that from one
mouse, your great-great-grandfather
Michael, there must be
now at least twelve billion descendants&mdash;or
six times the human
population of Earth!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know," George
said, interested despite himself.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me it never occurred
to you," the man from
the F.B.I. said, shaking a finger
at him, while George could see
that he kept the other hand on
the revolver in his pocket, "that
you mice have access to and
could destroy every secret file
we have!"</p>

<p>"No, it didn't," George said,
shrinking from that huge, shaking
finger. "We mice would never
destroy anything uselessly."</p>

<p>"Or that you could cut the
wires on any plane, tank, vehicle,
train or ship, rendering it completely
inoperable!" the General
broke in, slamming a meaty palm
down on the table so hard that
George was thrown over on his
back.</p>

<p>"Of course it never occurred to
me!" George said, climbing rockily
back on his feet. "We mice
wouldn't think of such a thing.
Don't be afraid," he pleaded, but
it was no use. He could feel the
panic in their breasts.</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever consider that
you could cut every cable, telephone
line, power line, and telegraph
line from the States to
Alaska?" the man from Alaskan
Affairs said, just for the sake of
saying something. Then, to show
his bravery and defiance, he took
his glass of water and emptied it
on George. It was ice water, and
poor George, dripping wet, began
to tremble uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"I suppose you never considered
that you could sabotage and
blow up every atomic plant we
have," the man from the A.E.C.
said, before George even had a
chance to answer Alaskan Affairs.
And, working himself into
a rage to overcome his fear, he
emptied <i>his</i> glass of ice water on
the trembling mouse.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_g.jpg" alt="G" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>eorge began to weep. "It
<i>never</i> occurred to me," he
sobbed. "We mice aren't like
that."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" the General said.
"It's the unchanging law of nature.
We must kill you or you will
kill us. And we'll start by killing
you!" The General roared
louder than all the rest because he
was the most frightened.</p>

<p>His hand, huge and terrible,
swept swiftly down on poor, wet,
weeping George. But the General
really didn't know mouse tactics
very well, because George was
down the leg of the table and
halfway to the mousehole before
the huge hand struck the table
with a noisy bang.</p>

<p>And poor George, frightened
half out of his wits, scooted into
the mousehole and ran and ran
without stopping, through the
mouseways as fast as he could,
until he reached the train. But,
of course, the train was no longer
moving. All the telepathic mice
had cut every cable, telephone
line, power line and telegraph line,
had also cut the wires on every
plane, tank, vehicle, train and
ship. They also had destroyed
every file in the world.</p>

<p>So George had no alternative
but to walk back to the plant,
which had been preserved as a
memorial to great-great-grandfather
Michael.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_i.jpg" alt="I" width="19" height="40" /></div>
<p>t took him three weary weeks
to make it, and the first thing
he noticed when he got there was
the trap in front of the door.
Naturally, there was no bait in it
and the spring wasn't set, but
the trap was still there.</p>

<p>"George," Clara said to him
the moment after she kissed him,
"you must speak to the janitor
about the trap."</p>

<p>So George went outside right
away, since he could hear the
janitor swish-swashing the dust
around.</p>

<p>"<i>Hello!</i>" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," the janitor
said. "So you're home again."</p>

<p>"My wife wants the trap moved,"
George said. "She's afraid
the children might get hurt."</p>

<p>"Sorry," the janitor replied.
"My orders were to put a mousetrap
by each mousehole."</p>

<p>"How come you didn't go away
with all the other people?" George
shouted up at him.</p>

<p>"Stop shouting," the janitor
said. Then, "I'm too old to
change," he added. "Besides, I
have a farm down the road."</p>

<p>"But haven't they stopped paying
you?" George demanded.</p>

<p>"What's the difference," the
janitor countered, "money can't
buy anything any more."</p>

<p>"Well, what will I tell my wife
about the trap?" George asked.</p>

<p>The janitor scratched his head.
"You might tell her that I'll take
it up with the supervisor, if he
ever comes back."</p>

<p>So George went inside and told
Clara.</p>

<p>"George," she said, stamping
her foot, "I can't go on with that
trap out there! You know that
supervisor won't come back, so
you've got to go out and find
him."</p>

<p>George, who knew that there
weren't many people around anywhere
any more, walked over to
his favorite easy chair and sat
down. "Clara," he said, as he
picked up a book, "you can leave
or stay as you wish, but there is
nothing more that I can do. I've
wasted a full month over that
trap without accomplishing a
single thing, and I'm not going to
start that business all over again."</p>
